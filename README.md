A go package to provide a set that knows its direct superset and direct members (sets or elements).

## Install and Usage
Install the package with:

```
go get github.com/kw510/set
```

import "githug.com/kw510/set"

## Why?

To show how ReBAC works from a set level. ReBAC with sets is a question s.t.
> Is this set a subset of another set
